# MetaSnapshotInfluence
(Made in Summer of 2020)


Hearthstone centered program accesses a web scraping API and manipulates the data to gauge the influence that the Tempo Storm Meta Snapshot on the average player's ranked ladder experience. The program does so by first reading the Meta Snapshot Tier list from TempoStorm as well as the decklists for all the decks. It then goes to HSreplay.com and reads the ranked usage statistics from the previous week as well as the most current. The program then compares the difference in usage from the previous week compared to the current usage, and displays the data organized in order given by the TempoStorm Meta Snapshot.
